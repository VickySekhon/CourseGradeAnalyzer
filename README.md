#Course Grade Analyzer

## What Does it Do?
A ```Userform``` that connects to a database is shown to the user. It lists available courses in a database following a schema identical to ```studentGrades.mdb```. 

From here you can select a course to gather information about and use SQL queries to find information about a course using the coursecode, Coursename, Student information (first name, last name, ID), and Student grades for that course (assignments, midterm, exam).

The program calculates:
o ```student final grades```
o	```class average```
o	```class minimum```
o	```class maximum``` 
o	```standard deviation``` 

From here a histogram representing the statistics above is generated on the spreadsheet.  

Finally, using student final grades a report is generated which includes the following: 
o	```A newly created word document```
o	```Copy of histogram of final grades```
o	```Table including all final grades```
o	```class minimum```
o	```class maximum```
o	```class average``` 
o	```Standard deviation```
