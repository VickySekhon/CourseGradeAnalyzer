#Course Grade Analyzer

## What Does it Do?
A ```Userform``` that connects to a database is shown to the user. It lists available courses in a database following a schema identical to ```studentGrades.mdb```. 

From here you can select a course to gather information about and use SQL queries to find information about a course using the coursecode, Coursename, Student information (first name, last name, ID), and Student grades for that course (assignments, midterm, exam).

The program calculates:
<ul>
  <li>student final grades</li>
  <li>class average</li>
  <li>class minimum</li>
  <li>class maximum</li>
  <li>standard deviation</li>
</ul>

From here a histogram representing the statistics above is generated on the spreadsheet.  

Finally, a report is generated using student final grades, including everything listed above but in a generated ```MS Word document```.

## Technologies 
I used ```VBA```, ```XML```, and ```SQL``` to create this project. 

## How to Run it 
<ol>
  <li>clone the repository</li>
  <li>open script.xlsm</li>
  <li>navigate to assignment 5 in the ribbon and click `connect to database`</li>
</ol>

Great experience overall, I really enjoyed making this project. Happy coding!
